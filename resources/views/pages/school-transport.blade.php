        School Transport Facility
    </h3>
    <p>
 
    “Unless we start using tanks to transport students, school buses will continue to be king when it comes to protecting pupils”.
    School transport is the safest way for kids to commute to the school. Keeping the convenience and safety of the students in mind, DAV Sector 14, Faridabad proudly possesses a fleet of 18(+7) buses carrying a huge number of students to and from the school regularly. All the buses are equipped with cameras and have advanced safety measures. School bus drivers are also screened and have received stringent training to observe Traffic Rules and Road Safety, use First Aid and Emergency procedures.

        TRANSPORTATION POLICY
    </h5>
    <p class="">  
    The school operates its own buses on specific routes, depending on the number of students on the route. Though we try our best, it may not always be possible to drop students at their doorstep or to accommodate requests for changes. Once a route has been finalised no changes/diversions can be entertained (unless very urgent), and the school seeks to support and co-operation from the parents for the same. If any student is found violating the code of conduct for the bus, the bus facility may be withdrawn. The onus of deciding the gravity of the situation is on the teacher in charge of the bus.
    </p>

    <h5 class="main-heading main-headingOverride">
    The transportation policies and procedures for parents are given below:
    </h5>
    <ol>
        <li> The list of stops is prepared keeping in view the convenience and safety of all the commuters. Therefore, buses cannot stop according to individual convenience.</li>
        <li> Parents are required to pick up the child from the designated stop. In case the parent/guardian/caretaker is not there to receive the child with the I-card, the driver is instructed to bring back the child to the school.</li>
        <li> In case of a change in route or destination, please inform the school transport authorities in writing, in advance, to facilitate efficient planning. </li>
        <li> Students in Class V or above will be allowed to enter their homes or compounds without being met by a parent/guardian/caretaker ONLY IF a signed authorization letter is on file with the school.</li>
        <li> Students will be held responsible for any damage caused to the bus by their negligence or vandalism and a fine will be incurred.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5 class="main-heading main-headingOverride">
    DISPERSAL OF THE CHILDREN USING PERSONAL OR PRIVATE TRANSPORT:
    </h5>
    <p class="">  
    Students who come to school on their own should arrive at the school before the bell rings. No student is allowed to come to school in a self-driven scooter/motorcycle/car. Please note that no request seeking permission to allow the child to go to friends’/relatives’ houses shall be entertained.
